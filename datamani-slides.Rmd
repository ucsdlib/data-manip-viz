## Dplyr 

>At the most basic level, you can only alter a tidy data frame in five useful ways: you can reorder the rows (`arrange())`, pick observations and variables of interest (`filter()` and `select()``), add new variables that are functions of existing variables (`mutate()``), or collapse many values to a summary (`summarise()`). 


## Challenge 1

> Using pipes, subset the data to include rows before 1995. Retain columns
> `year`, `sex`, and `weight.`

## Solution

```{r}
library(magrittr)
surveys %>% 
  filter(year < 1995) %>%
  select(year, sex, weight) %>% 
  head()
```

## Challenge 2 

> How many times was each `plot_type` surveyed?


## Solution 

```{r}
surveys %>% 
  group_by(plot_id) %>% 
  tally %>% 
  head()
```

## Challenge 3 

> Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot
> length for each species.

## Solution
```{r}
surveys %>% 
  group_by(species_id) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hindfoot = mean(hindfoot_length, na.rm = TRUE),
            min_hindfoot = min(hindfoot_length, na.rm = TRUE), 
            max_hindfoot = max(hindfoot_length, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  filter(!is.nan(mean_hindfoot))
```
